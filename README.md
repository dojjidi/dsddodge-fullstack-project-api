## What is it? 
- This progress tracker was thought up because of a specific need that I have to fill. A place to track scores for various games and read them with some manner of ease.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to sign in / sign up
- As a user, I want to log out
- As a user, I want to Create a new game
- As a user, I want to Read multiple games from the list
- As a user, I want to Read a single game from the list
- As a user, I want to Update a game that I have submitted
- As a user, I want to Delete one of the games that I have submitted

### Unsolved Problems
- Still need to get all of the CRUD resources cooperating with the front end

- Would like to eventually expand on the app (or start on a new one) and have it import stats from an existing game API (pulling straight from Valorant, etc...)
